*  Evaluation
** Definition
*** Gather data of the usability of a design for a particular\n acivity by a specified group of users within a certain env
** Goals

*** Access extent of system functionality (Func)
*** Access effect of interface on user (UI)
*** Identify specific problem with system 
** Formative vs Summative

*** Formative
**** Used when project is formming
**** Done earlier, continuous, iterative
**** "Evaluating design"

*** Summative
**** After a system has been finished
**** Make judgement on final product
**** Evaluating the implentation

** Meothds

*** Empiricial
**** Real users and real data

*** Formal
**** HCI model
***** Will be taught later by Nisha

*** Automated 
**** Google analyitics
**** Measure how long a person take to click a button
**** How long a person go back to a sight
**** AB Testing?

*** Predictive/Critique
**** Expertise & Heuristic Feedback
**** Someone's expertise.
**** Examples
***** Herusitic Evaluation
***** COgntive
***** Pluralistic Walkthrough(Not covered)


* Empiricial
** Done Real users and real data
*** Verifiable or Provable 
*** Qualitative ["User give their feelings"] \n Quatitative ["Error rate"]
*** Early(Formative)
**** Do with paper prototype
*** Later(Summative)
**** Out in the wild
***** Mobile app and ask someone to use it \n (Not controlled env)
**** Field studies
**** UI on kiosk


** Examples
*** Lab studies
**** Close lab setting
**** Manipulate independent variable
**** Compare experimental group with control group
***** Old UI vs New UI
**** Pros
***** Replicable
**** Cons
***** Expensive (50/user sometimes)
***** Req Real Users and Lab

*** Field Studies(Out in the wild)
**** Observation in real life setting
**** Natural Env
**** Watch process over time
**** Pros
***** Ecologically Valid (More realisitic)
***** Cheap, quick, less training Required
**** Cons
***** Not Reproducible ( Cannot control env)
***** Not quantitative (Cannot compare data )

*** "THINK ALOUD"
**** Ask user to think aloud while doing task
**** Speak while completing task | issue | Confusion
****  Evaulator Role
***** Take note
***** Conduct observation of the user
***** Record vid | audio
***** Analyze data
**** Problem they may face.
***** User may not think aloud whilst in a confused state
****** Prompt user but not hint\n(Ask what are they confused about rather than given answer)
** User Task
*** Give something generic\nNOT Specific
**** Give a goal or Objective
**** Measures and question
***** Time taken, Error mades, Success Rate


* Heuristic Evaluation
** Nelsen 10 Heuristic
*** Need around 3 - 5 expert
*** Evaluators Process
**** Step through design several times
**** Examine against heurisitc
**** Fix problem | Redesign
** Multiple Evalutors
** Single = 35% of problem\n5 evaluator = 75%
** Phases
*** Pre-evaluation
**** Give context or knowledge on scenario
*** Evaluation
**** Individual evaluate then aggregate results
*** Severity Rating
**** priority to fix
*** Debrief
****  Design team talk to evaluator to fix issue
*** 2 passes for each evalutor
**** first to get feel
**** focus on finding issue
